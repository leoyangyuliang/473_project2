    III.Requirements:
    
    1.Working with other teams:

        You may discuss your project and the technologies you are using with other teams but each team 
        must build its own application and submit its own work.

    2.Working with members of your team In general: 

        each student in a group will receive the same grade. If you run into issues with your teammates,
        it is your responsibility to attempt to resolve them. If you are unable to work with a member of 
        your team (for example, if they disappear and fail to respond to attempts to contact them), bring 
        the problem to my attention as soon as possible do not wait until the due date.

    3.Presentations:

        On presentation day, you will have 15 minutes to give a short demonstration of your application
        to the class. Include both functionality and implementation details. Your entire team must be 
        present and available to answer questions, but individual team members may volunteer to deliver 
        the presentation.

    4.Grading:

        Each of the following factors contributes up to 3 points to the final grade for the project,
        for a total of 30
        points:

        1. Quality of the presentation
        2. Quality of documentation for installing and configuring the application

        submission, print the next two sheets, fill out the spaces on the first sheet,and submit both sheets to
